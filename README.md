Setting Up the ESP8266 Module
Download and Extract Files:

Download the ESP8266_json.zip file and extract it.

Open the Arduino Code:

Go to the folder Arduino code for programming the module ESP8266.

Open the      ESP8266_Reporter_connect microcontroller.txt      file and copy the code.

Install Libraries and Paste Code:

Open the Arduino software.

Download the ESP8266 library.

Paste the copied code into the Arduino software.

Configure Board and Port:

In Arduino, set the board to ESP8266.

Configure the USB-to-Serial adapter port (baud rate should be 115200).

Connect Pins:

Connect the adapter pins to the module (ensure the module uses 3.3V).

Reset the Module:

Connect the GPIO0 pin to GND.

Connect the module's reset pin to GND for one second and then disconnect it to reset the module.

Compile the code into the module (ensure the password, server address, modem name, and port match your server and specifications).

Reconnect and Display MAC Address:

After compiling, disconnect the GPIO0 pin and reset the module.

The module‚Äôs MAC address will be displayed initially.

Program the Microcontroller:

Program the microcontroller using the bascom folder.

If you do not wish to use Bascom, program the microcontroller with the Atmega16_report.hex file.

Activate the external crystal fuse bit.

Use the Proteus Folder:

Go to the proteus folder for connections, schematics, and additional help.

Start the Local Server:

After assembly, click on Start server.bat in the server folder to start the local server.

Go Online:

For real online use, utilize the two package and server files in the server folder (this method is JSON-based).

Set Up Android Software:

All these steps are explained on YouTube.

https://youtu.be/PV-M5d7y2hA

Paste the main file into the page folder of the Android software to display the soifgo program

!!!!!
Note: If you don't want to keep a computer running as a local server, you can use another ESP8266 module with the first method described but this time using the ESP8266_Server_solo_just_need_power.txt code. Configure this code on another module using Arduino. Note that this module also requires the modem name and password. After uploading the code, the module will announce its MAC address and its own address on each restart. You will need this address for the first module or the reporter connected to the microcontroller. This server module doesn't need anything else except for 3.3 volts to continue operating. Now you can issue your commands in soifgo; the server module will receive them and transfer them to the reporter module. You can network several soifgos with several reporters, but there will be only one server module

'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
GET API
In soifgo, you can easily make GET API requests. To do this, you first need to find the hosting site, obtain the key and address, and then configure the button behavior and server request. Set the address field, filter field, and key field so that in the soifgo run mode, the request is automatically sent, and the result is displayed on the created button. Note that there are two types of responses:

Text Response: Set the filter field to 0. If you have a custom response

Value Response: The received value will be rounded off, meaning there will be no decimal places. For example, 123.125 will be converted to 123.

If there is no endpoint in the filter, set it to 0.

Example
Let's say you want to read the Bitcoin price from 
   
https://www.diadata.org/free-crypto-api

Go to the bottom of the page, select Bitcoin, and click on "Show Address". Then, select "coin data", choose "btc", click "run feed", then on the right click on "API endpoint" and copy the URL. Check the result in your browser:

Graph :

Graphs in soifgo receive values from the button's behavior on the receiver, whether through Bluetooth, API, or server, and they only accept integers between 0 and 99,999. Graphs work with three schedules: internal, external, and oscilloscope. Each graph can have its own specific address, color, and schedule. Graphs are saved in the soifgo Graph folder with the page folder name and the initial button name at the bottom of the graph, and this process continues until the graph is fully drawn and then saved. If the connection is interrupted, the graphing stops but will resume once reconnected. However, if you exit the program, graphing will not continue, and upon restarting the program, the first page will replace the previously named page. To avoid overwriting, you can take a backup or change the button name so that new files are saved separately from the previous ones. If you have multiple graphs with different names for the same button, don't worry. In the end, in graph review mode, simply change the button name to the corresponding graph name to summon and review that graph.

In graphs, four modes are considered:

Mode One: This mode takes an input value between 0 and 999999 over an internal adjustable scheduling period. At the end of the graph drawing, a folder is created in Swift Design graph with the name of the page. Within this folder, a file named "Button" will be created where each graph is stored in order. If you wish to continue graph recording later, you must be on the last empty page. For example, if you have drawn 5 graphs and wish to continue later, click on the graph and use the page forward icon to go to the end until you see the empty page message. You can then append your new graphs to the previous ones. Note that graphs are not saved until they are completed. Even if they are midway, they are not saved until they reach the end of the button.

Mode Two: Similar to the first mode but without saving the graph. In this mode, you will have zoom functionality where you can zoom in up to 20 times horizontally. Clicking in this mode will freeze the graph on the next page so you can review its quantitative properties. Clicking again will resume graph recording. This mode is suitable for temporary and experimental graphs or oscilloscopes with the phone's internal timer.

Mode Three: Similar to the first mode with saving, but not based on the internal timer. Here, with each input value, we move forward one unit. So, if the input speed is high, the graph will be drawn faster, or you can send data slowly per minute depending on your application.

Mode Four: Similar to the third mode without saving, with zoom functionality. This mode is ideal for creating an oscilloscope or viewing wave samples with zoom and freeze capabilities.

Note: If you exit the program and start graphing again, the first graphing page will be considered as the initial state, and the first page graphing will be deleted, replacing it with subsequent graphs. So, if yesterday's graph is important to you, back it up, or better yet, click on the graph and go to the last empty page to keep the initial graphs intact. Alternatively, you can change the name of the button to have a new series of graphs without altering the previous ones. If you want to see the previous graph, just change the button name back. If you receive a graph folder from a friend, you can also set the button name to match the received graph to view or continue those graphs

With a click on any running graph, a list view (Run/Stop View) will be displayed, and if you are in the non-saving mode, a zoom option will be added

note out :

When the button is configured in behavior note mode, you can use the info icon in the top left corner. By selecting the task option from the info list, you can choose between two types of tasks: sending via Bluetooth or sending via API/Server.

'''''''''''''
Send via Bluetooth:

In this mode, you can send your text to the Bluetooth serial output. The send icon will appear at the top of the screen. By long-pressing this icon, you can access the send type settings, listed from top to bottom:

Delay:

After selecting the delay, a time selection bar will appear at the bottom of the screen. Note that the times depend on the phone's internal timer. Ensure the custom wait option is turned off. In this mode, the first line of your text is sent as the command, and subsequent lines wait for the delay time to elapse before being sent. The delay time is the same for all lines.

LF RF:

This setting defines the data send method and how it is received by the recipient. It includes characters 10 and 13 or the absence thereof, sequential reception, or next line reception. This setting should be configured according to the recipient's method.

Automatic Sending: This setting determines whether the sending is manual or automatic. In manual mode, an icon appears for each send, which you click to send the line. In automatic mode, the sending is done automatically based on delay settings, custom delays, or input checks.

Input Check:

This setting is for serial echo or verifying the correctness of the sent value. The recipient should resend what it receives, and the data is checked. If the received and sent data match, the next line is sent. If not, it checks 5 times and gives an error if the send is not confirmed.

Next  Word Check:

If the word "next" or "NEXT" is received, the next line is sent. This setting is suitable for actions with unspecified durations. For example, in a loader where start and end times vary, the next word triggers the next command when a switch is defined at the end.

Custom Wait:

This method allows you to set custom times for sending lines. The times must be written in the text, following this format:

First line: Command

Second line: Time in seconds (only numbers) 

Example:

motor ON
23
Fan ON
11
Vacuum OFF
5


If there is an error in your text, it will give an error.

Loop:

This setting repeats your text or commands. Once activated, your text starts again from the first line after the last line is completed.


 Send via Server/API:
 
All functionalities of this method are similar to the Bluetooth send method, with the following differences:

The input check and next word options are removed.

Writing method when using delay:


First line: Address with port

Second line: Key or keyword

Third line: Data value or sending value


Writing method when using custom wait:


First line: Address with port

Second line: Key or keyword

Third line: Data value or sending value

Fourth line: Delay time in seconds (only numbers)

Phone Sensor:

In the Phone Sensor section, you can use the sensors inside the phone in soifgo. These sensors work normally, and if you select the active options of these sensors, the program can use the values of these sensors. By enabling the Display Sensor Values option, you can see the values and addresses of these sensors.

Preferably, these sensors are included in the ending addresses 991 to 994 so that buttons can read and display them through these addresses. The application of reading these sensors can lead to button effects. To read the sensors, just set the button behavior to the Bluetooth Receive mode and then enter the sensor address:

Address 991 for the light sensor: You can get the maximum value from the sensor display section by shining a lot of light like the sun.

Address 992 for the X-axis rotation sensor: You can get the maximum value from the sensor display section by rotating the phone until the maximum positive is visible. The sensor value may be decimal and negative. Note that the buttons work from 0 upwards, so by multiplying the number, correct the decimal part and by adding a suitable number, make the negative part positive. For example, if the sensor shows 1.52, this number must be multiplied by 100 to be read as 152. Now, for example, we have a maximum negative of -2.11, which becomes -211. So, multiply by 10 and add 211. Now the sensor's minimum value is 0 and the maximum is 422, and 210 is the balance or median.

Address 993 for the Y-axis rotation sensor: Similar to the explanation above.

Address 994 for the magnetic sensor: Pay attention that the output may vary slightly in different phones. With the help of a coefficient and a magnet, you can find the highest resolution. The type of multiplication and addition is similar to the explanation above.

Now you can have your desired programs such as light measurement, graphs, and movements by selecting button effects. Create programs like a scale or metal detector.

If you want to move a device or toy using the phone's internal rotation sensors, just set the button behavior to Bluetooth Send mode. Then, using the Sensor option, select the desired sensor. The sensor value will be sent to the Bluetooth serial output, and if you wish to have a suffix or address appended to the sent value, just enter that sentence or address inside the textbox.

With sensor value changes, the sensor values will be automatically sent to the Bluetooth serial output. Note that in this feature, the sent number is not negative; it is 0 and above.

Additionally, you can view the sent value on the button itself. This value is only for display purposes and is not sent! You can configure the display options as "Name + Value + Address," "Value + Address + Name," "Value + Address," "Value," or "Name."

Important: In the section for setting the sensor to be sent, configuring another address will not send the value with addresses 991 to 994, because only the sensor value itself is sent. If you enter an address in the textbox, the value will be attached to your address and sent together, with the value first and then the address concatenated.



# üîå Real-Time Input Injection into HTML via soifgo


### üåü soifgo: Dynamic HTML Interaction Framework

soifgo allows users to connect real-time data sources‚Äîlike sensors, APIs, or Bluetooth‚Äîto dynamic HTML views. Here's how the system works step-by-step:

---

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 1: Configure Input Sources
Within the soifgo interface, the user defines what each button represents:
- **Button 1** might be linked to the phone's light sensor.
- **Button 2** could be set to receive data from Bluetooth.
- And so on up to Button 40.

---

#### üß© Step 2: Link HTML Display
In the second section, the user selects a custom HTML layout and enables variable injection.

Once activated, the HTML view opens, showing its original structure. The user can begin editing directly, but **variable injection must follow a precise syntax**:

--- *val1#   Button 1   to   *val40#   Button 40    

#### üìå Injecting Variables
To insert dynamic data from a button source into HTML:

- Simply type:  
  ```html
  *val1#
  ```
- This refers to **Button 1's value**.

Example before transformation:
```html
<h2>*val1#</h2>
```

After soifgo processes it (either automatically or via your ApplyHTMLVal function):
```html
<h2><span id='*val1#'>*val1#</span></h2>
```

Example before transformation:
```html
<h2>*val1#  *val3#</h2>
```

After soifgo processes it (either automatically or via your ApplyHTMLVal function):
```html
<h2><span id='*val1#'>*val1#</span>  <span id='*val3#'>*val3#</span></h2>
```

This allows JavaScript to interact with it using:
```javascript
function setVal(index, value) {
  var el = document.getElementById('*val' + index + '#');
  if (el) {
    el.innerText = value;
  }
}
```

#### üéØ Result
- The light sensor value appears dynamically in the HTML without refreshing the page.
- The rest of the interface (e.g. signal generator, controls) **remains intact**, avoiding reinitialization.
- This lets you process, visualize, and manipulate sensor data, all inside HTML‚Äîsmoothly and live.
