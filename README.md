soifdesign is an adaptable app for creating and managing custom UIs. Features include web views, PDF handling, image viewing, HTML editing, and serial data transmission via Bluetooth. Customizable buttons and startup options enhance user experience.



SoifDesign" is derived from two words: "soif" which means "thirst" in French and "design" which means "design

This is a simple Android app designed to help enthusiasts with object control, electronics, and the internet.

This program includes 40 buttons and 10 bars. With these buttons and volume bars, you will be able to perform tasks such as serial Bluetooth, APIs, Internet of Things (IoT) behaviors, and more.

When you open the program in SoifDesign, you will see icons at the top. From left to right:

Info Icon: This icon provides lists to help you and changes in different modes of the program.

Bluetooth Icon: After connecting to the serial Bluetooth, this icon will give you a list of available Bluetooth devices. You can select the desired Bluetooth device from the list. For subsequent selections, you don't need to find the Bluetooth again. If there is a problem or you want to choose another device, you can reset it by long pressing the Bluetooth icon.

Play Icon: This icon toggles between two pages. In play mode, the program runs in execution mode. In pause or edit mode, the program can be adjusted. When this icon blinks yellow, it means your actions have been saved.

Edit Page Explanation: When you click on the Play icon, you enter the edit page. From the top left to right:

Info Icon: Here, it performs other tasks such as opening pages, saving pages, copying, etc.

Screen Lock Icon: Keeps the screen on.

Sound Icon: A menu to mute the menu sounds.

Bluetooth Icon: As previously mentioned.

Button and Volume Bar Summon Icon: With this icon, you can edit the background of the page with a solid color or image, or you can grid the background.

Buttons: You can create up to 40 buttons. The remaining buttons will be displayed here. Volume Bars: You have 10 volume bars, and the remaining ones will also be displayed.

Startup: A simple timer section for buttons. If needed, you can schedule the buttons so that buttons 1 to 40 are clicked automatically each time the program runs.

When you summon buttons and volume bars, two other sections will be displayed. If you have buttons or volume bars that overlap and you cannot identify their location, these two options will help you find their location

Button: If you summon a button, you can immediately determine its initial position by tapping on the screen with your finger. After a few seconds, this feature will disappear and the button will become fixed. You can also fix the button by pressing the back key on your phone.

When you click on the button, the design icon will appear at the top left, next to the info icon. Clicking on this icon allows you to configure the behaviors and design of the button, listed from top to bottom:

Background: In this section, you can design or change the button color, background image, and button text.

Name: Here, you can change the button name. Note that in receive mode, this name comes after the received number, so it can include suffixes like kilometer, degree, or refer to the nature of the input. You can also enable or disable the display of the name in the top label.

Size: In this section, you can change the button size using two volume bars, horizontally and vertically.

Movement: This section has two parts: free movement by touching the screen to move the button and precise movement using four directional buttons.

Behavior: In this section, you define what behavior the button should have based on your needs. Clicking on this option will display a blue label at the top right. Clicking on this label will show the behavior list.

Reset Behavior: This will erase any existing behavior of the button.

Send Behavior: In this section, three types of sending behavior for the button are defined: Bluetooth, SMS, and server (API).

For Bluetooth sending, you can enter your desired text or value, and then determine the type of sending for the serial Bluetooth module by setting the 13 and 10 character sequences. For SMS, you can enter the target phone number at the top and the message text at the bottom. This section is intended for sending commands to SMS controllers, but you can also use it to send predefined messages to friends. The API sending section has three parts: the API address, the message or value for the API, and the key or keyword for the API. This sending is specific to JSON and can be done online or locally via the WiFi module to control objects at home locally.

Receive Behavior: There are four types of receiving behavior:

Bluetooth Receiving:

As text: Receive any text.

As value: In this type, you must enter the maximum sending value in the first box and enable or disable the display of the value in the top label of this box. In the second box, enter the filter address. For example, if you're sending a value to the phone, it should be between 100 and 999. If you want to send the number 4 to address 125, enter 125 in this box. The address won't be displayed, only the value on the button. Values must be between 0 and 1999; decimal numbers or text within these numbers will cause problems. Note that in this case, the button's effect list will be activated in the behavior list.

API Receiving:

As text: Receive any text from the specified API address with a keyword.

In the first box, enter the API address. The second box is for the filter address, which is initially set to 0 but can be adjusted. If set, its behavior will be similar to the Bluetooth value receiving case. This is mainly used for receiving text or addressed values, particularly for WiFi modules or IoT. The third box is for the API keyword.

Search Boxes:

These two boxes are for searching specific words. If the API response contains several words, you can use these boxes to specify the start of the previous word and the end of the next word to display the middle word. For example, if the response is "abcde 123 efc," entering "abcde" in the start box and "efc" in the end box will display "123."

API Value Receiving:

Similar to the previous receiving, but with an added box for the maximum value and an option to enable or disable value display. This type, similar to Bluetooth value receiving, activates the button effect list when enabled. This type of receiving is for values or numbers, not decimal numbers or text, and must be between 0 and 1999. Therefore, the value receiving can be from the API server or the local home network WiFi module.

Web Behavior:

Enabling this behavior gives you two options: one for online web page viewing, which may not be very professional, and another for opening offline HTML files by clicking on the "online" label.

By clicking on the label, you can open HTML files. This feature allows you to have HTML format apps to meet your needs. You can edit these files with HTML programming or AI, place them in a text file, change the file extension from "txt" to "html," and transfer it to the HTML folder in SoifDesign. This way, you can have your custom app on the button.

Image Behavior:

This option is for having a taken photo or a reminder photo.

Text Behavior:

This behavior provides simple note-taking capabilities in the info icon in play mode, including background color, text color, text size, alignment, and saving options. The first time you select this behavior, a "Hello" file will be provided, which you can save with a different name if needed.

Main Purpose:

The main purpose of including text behavior in SoifDesign is for sending text to the serial Bluetooth. For example, in the first line, you can command to turn on a motor, and in the following lines, add other commands. When you click the send icon, these commands are sent line by line to the output.

PDF Behavior:

This behavior is for having PDF files and creating a PDF library. Note that PDF files must be in the "pdf" folder within SoifDesign

Returning to the Button Design List: Upon returning to the button design list after explaining the behaviors, we move on to page loading.

Page Loading: After designing the buttons, their behaviors, volume bars, etc., you can rename and save your page using the info icon. This file is saved as a text file in the SoifDesign page folder. Using the page loading option, you can load a previously saved page into another page. As a result, the summoned page will open, and the current page will close.

You are not limited to creating a single page; you can have multiple pages with different programs, behaviors, and buttons, and move between them.

Audio: This option allows you to assign a sound to a button, so that when the button is pressed, a sound is played. Note that the sound files should be in the audio folder. To have more sound files, you need to add them to this folder. If you use a file with long playback, such as music, clicking the button will replay the sound. Long pressing the button will stop the playback.

Vibration: This option gives a selectable vibration to the button. Using the volume bar that appears, you can select the desired vibration intensity.

Hidden Options:

Effect: Effects become active when the button's behavior is set to numerical receiving, whether Bluetooth or API.

Size Change Effect: This effect changes the button's size based on the incoming values. For example, if creating a thermometer, you need to change the height size. The minimum input value is the initial button size, and the maximum value is the size set with the vertical or horizontal volume bar. So, if the value ranges from 0 to 1000, the button size will change accordingly.

Circular Gauge Effect: This effect draws a circular gauge behind the button. If the button is rounded using the kernel setting, and you use this effect, a dynamic circular gauge will be displayed. You can also set the start and end points.

Movement Effect: This effect is suitable for creating balancers or scales, or for moving blades. Movement is controlled using the lower volume bars, moving the button to the right or upward. Unlike the size change effect, the button size remains fixed, and only the position changes.

Rotation Effect: This effect is for rotating the button. If you set the button background to an arrow or pointer, this effect will start rotating the button. You can also set the initial and final rotation angles using the two lower volume bars.

Color Effect: This effect changes the button's background color based on input changes, suitable for indicating temperature changes, battery level, and more.

Graph Effect: This effect converts incoming values into a graph. In this effect and setting, you can select the thickness and color of the drawn lines, the type of value reception, and the time interval. Four types of reception are considered:

Internal time selection with saving capability: At each graph completion, the page is saved with the button name and page number suffix in the graph folder in SoifDesign. Note that starting a new graph on the same page will delete the previous graph, so it's better to move to the last page to continue.

Internal time selection without saving: This option includes a zoom feature.

External trigger: Moves forward one unit whenever an input value is received, with saving capability.

External trigger without saving: Suitable for viewing fast graphs like oscilloscopes.

Access these options using the info icon.

Alarm: This hidden option activates in numerical receiving mode, whether serial Bluetooth or API server. The alarm value must be between 0 and the maximum input value. By clicking on the alarm label, you can set the alarm type to minimum or maximum. In the lower box, you can write the displayed alarm text. Note that the sound set for the button will also be played during the alarm, so you can set a suitable alarm sound.

end button :


soifdesign offers object-oriented programmable buttons (40 in total) and 10 sliders with serial Bluetooth transmission capabilities. Create and summon custom menus, build and manage PDF libraries, edit HTML files, and turn them into libraries for further use. soifdesign can send and receive server APIs as well.

Receipts can be displayed in two formats:

Textual

Addressed values, where each address can have a defined maximum value.

This feature allows the creation of various effects on the buttons, including rotation, resizing, moving, color changes, and graphics. For example, you can create a rotating analog needle with input values from 0 to 1000, a graphical thermometer with size change effects, or a balancer with moving effects. You can even create a battery icon that changes color with voltage drop. Remember, to achieve noticeable changes, you should consider minimum input values; for instance, values from 0 to 5 won't show significant effects, but higher values like 0 to 500 or 1000 will. For a complete rotation, at least values from 0 to 360 should be applied, or for proper color changes, remember that color values range up to 255.

soifdesign also supports copy-paste for repetitive tasks. Just create a detailed button and paste its properties to other buttons.

Additionally, soifdesign allows for navigation between created pages. You can create numerous menus and pages, adding sound and vibration to buttons for a pleasant feel. You can share your designs by sharing the text files of the pages. If documents, images, and PDFs are included, it's better to share the related folders as well.

Notes in soifdesign do more than just note-taking. They also serve various tasks such as saving notes, recalling notes, converting to HTML in HTML file editing, and sending commands in serial output in two ways: line by line or with a command line followed by a timer. This enables you to create programmable processes. You can write scenarios as notes and send them to the microcontroller in Note Out to execute your desired operations.

ESP8266 Project

The ESP8266 WiFi module creates a two-way connection between soifdesign and the microcontroller with a local server. If needed, you can extract the package and server files from the server folder and upload them to your online server for a remote online control experience. The source files of the ESP8266 server project are available and unrestricted for you to enhance and improve.

Rangmang Project

Rangmang is a project designed to control RGB LED strips via Bluetooth serial commands using soifdesign. This project allows users to program and control WS2812B LED strips to create stunning lighting effects. soifdesign acts as the interface to send commands to the microcontrollers, enabling dynamic color changes and patterns. The source files of the Rangmang project are available and unrestricted for you to enhance and improve.
At the end of the README, you can learn more about Rangmang in detail. Additionally, there is a PDF file available for setup inside the Rangmang compressed file. You can also visit the SoifDesign channel on YouTube to watch a video of the Rangmang project.

Sending Notes via Bluetooth or Internet:(note to serial _ note out _note to api _note to bluetooth )

In soifdesign, you can easily send your notes to a Bluetooth port or an API. Here, we will explain the Bluetooth section.

Before sending, ensure that your phone's Bluetooth is paired with the desired module or device.

Step One: Click on the soifdesign Bluetooth icon. From the list that appears, click on the desired device to establish the connection.
Step Two: Click the play icon to switch it to edit or pause mode. Then, click on the 3D cube icon. From the list, bring up a button and click it. Next, click on the top left menu and select “Behavior” from the list. A blue icon will appear on the right; click it to display the list of behaviors and select the "Note Behavior" option.

Choose the default note hello.text. Then, click on the paused play icon to switch to live/play mode. Now, click the button to display the note.

Write your desired text. To save the note with a different name, click on the top left menu. From the "Note Job" menu, select "Send via Bluetooth."

When you click on the note, a send icon will appear at the top beside the menu. Long press this icon. From the list, configure the sending behavior:

Cancel: Cancel or exit the list.
Delay: Selecting this brings up a volume bar to set line-by-line delay increments, with each step being 0.125 milliseconds. This delay applies to manual mode but does not work in custom line-by-line delays.
Send Format: Choose standard sending formats depending on your needs, such as next line, sequential lines, etc. Options include CR+LF, CR, LF, STX/ETX, NULL, or NON.
Manual or Automatic Line Sending:
- In manual mode, an icon appears for line-by-line sending. There is no delay in this mode; only the format can be selected.
- Clicking the send icon enables manual line sending. Each click sends the first line, and subsequent clicks send the following lines one by one until the icon disappears. To repeat, click the send icon again and repeat the process.
- In automatic mode, clicking the send icon sends lines automatically based on your configuration. You can pause or stop by clicking the send icon again, and clicking it once more resumes the process.

Check-In: Activate check-in to ensure that each sent line returns an exact match before allowing the next line to be sent. This functions as a serial echo.
Next Check: This option is similar to "Check-In" but only reacts to the word NEXT (or next). It waits longer for this response before sending the next line. This feature is useful for tasks with uncertain completion times (e.g., robotic arms, conveyors, or heating elements). The system sends the next line only after receiving the NEXT response.
Custom Wait: This special mode requires careful note writing, as it follows a specific format. For example:
- Line 1: Desired text (sent immediately).
- Line 2: Wait time in seconds (e.g., "8" for an 8-second delay).
- Line 3: Next text to send after the delay.
In this mode, the second option in the delay list is deactivated.
Loop: Enabling this option repeats the lines automatically in a loop after reaching the end. It works in automatic sending mode.

Important:

If you add a new command to the note, ensure you save it by clicking the info icon in the top left and selecting save. Unsaved commands will not execute and will not be saved upon closing the note.

In manual sending mode, avoid using the timer value or custom wait as it will result in improper output.

Server Mode:

Similar to Bluetooth mode with slight differences.

In initial settings, select the server sending mode.

Two Writing Modes:

Without Custom Wait:

- Address
- Value
- Value
- Value

- Example:

- http://192.168.1.104:3000/GET123
- LED1_ON
- LED1_OF
- LED2_ON
- LED2_OF
- LED3_ON
- LED3_OF
- LED4_ON
- LED4_OF
- LED5_ON
- LED5_OF
- LED6_ON
- LED6_OF

With Custom Wait:

- Address
- Value
- Timer (in seconds, between 0 to 3600)
- Value

- LED6_OF
- 2



Note: An empty line will terminate the program.

Note: No check-in or next reception in server mode.

Settings:

Delay, Auto/Manual Sending, Custom Wait, and Loop are similar to Bluetooth mode.

Important:

Save new commands by clicking the info icon in the top left and selecting save. Unsaved commands will not execute and will not be saved upon closing the note.

In manual sending mode, avoid using the timer value or custom wait as it will result in improper output.

Download the ESP8266 library.

Paste the copied code into the Arduino software.

Configure Board and Port:

In Arduino, set the board to ESP8266.

Configure the USB-to-Serial adapter port (baud rate should be 115200).

Connect Pins:

Connect the adapter pins to the module (ensure the module uses 3.3V).

Reset the Module:

Connect the GPIO0 pin to GND.

Connect the module's reset pin to GND for one second and then disconnect it to reset the module.

Compile the code into the module (ensure the password, server address, modem name, and port match your server and specifications).

Reconnect and Display MAC Address:

After compiling, disconnect the GPIO0 pin and reset the module.

The module’s MAC address will be displayed initially.

Program the Microcontroller:

Program the microcontroller using the bascom folder.

If you do not wish to use Bascom, program the microcontroller with the Atmega16_report.hex file.

Activate the external crystal fuse bit.

Use the Proteus Folder:

Go to the proteus folder for connections, schematics, and additional help.

Start the Local Server:

After assembly, click on Start server.bat in the server folder to start the local server.

All these steps are explained on YouTube.

https://youtu.be/PV-M5d7y2hA

Paste the main file into the page folder of the Android software to display the soifdesign program

!!!!!
Note: If you don't want to keep a computer running as a local server, you can use another ESP8266 module with the first method described but this time using the ESP8266_Server_solo_just_need_power.txt code. Configure this code on another module using Arduino. Note that this module also requires the modem name and password. After uploading the code, the module will announce its MAC address and its own address on each restart. You will need this address for the first module or the reporter connected to the microcontroller. This server module doesn't need anything else except for 3.3 volts to continue operating. Now you can issue your commands in SwiftDesign; the server module will receive them and transfer them to the reporter module. You can network several SwiftDesigns with several reporters, but there will be only one server module

'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
GET API
In SwiftDesign, you can easily make GET API requests. To do this, you first need to find the hosting site, obtain the key and address, and then configure the button behavior and server request. Set the address field, filter field, and key field so that in the SwiftDesign run mode, the request is automatically sent, and the result is displayed on the created button. Note that there are two types of responses:

Text Response: Set the filter field to 0. If you have a custom response, you can set this filter between 100 to 999.

Value Response: The received value will be rounded off, meaning there will be no decimal places. For example, 123.125 will be converted to 123.

If there is no endpoint in the filter, set it to 0.

Example
Let's say you want to read the Bitcoin price from 
   
https://www.diadata.org/free-crypto-api

Go to the bottom of the page, select Bitcoin, and click on "Show Address". Then, select "coin data", choose "btc", click "run feed", then on the right click on "API endpoint" and copy the URL. Check the result in your browser:

Go to the play page and see the updated price. For other APIs, you need to get the address and key. You can use artificial intelligence to help


Graph :

Graphs in SwiftDesign receive values from the button's behavior on the receiver, whether through Bluetooth, API, or server, and they only accept integers between 0 and 99,999. Graphs work with three schedules: internal, external, and oscilloscope. Each graph can have its own specific address, color, and schedule. Graphs are saved in the SwiftDesign Graph folder with the page folder name and the initial button name at the bottom of the graph, and this process continues until the graph is fully drawn and then saved. If the connection is interrupted, the graphing stops but will resume once reconnected. However, if you exit the program, graphing will not continue, and upon restarting the program, the first page will replace the previously named page. To avoid overwriting, you can take a backup or change the button name so that new files are saved separately from the previous ones. If you have multiple graphs with different names for the same button, don't worry. In the end, in graph review mode, simply change the button name to the corresponding graph name to summon and review that graph.

In graphs, four modes are considered:

Mode One: This mode takes an input value between 0 and 999999 over an internal adjustable scheduling period. At the end of the graph drawing, a folder is created in Swift Design graph with the name of the page. Within this folder, a file named "Button" will be created where each graph is stored in order. If you wish to continue graph recording later, you must be on the last empty page. For example, if you have drawn 5 graphs and wish to continue later, click on the graph and use the page forward icon to go to the end until you see the empty page message. You can then append your new graphs to the previous ones. Note that graphs are not saved until they are completed. Even if they are midway, they are not saved until they reach the end of the button.

Mode Two: Similar to the first mode but without saving the graph. In this mode, you will have zoom functionality where you can zoom in up to 20 times horizontally. Clicking in this mode will freeze the graph on the next page so you can review its quantitative properties. Clicking again will resume graph recording. This mode is suitable for temporary and experimental graphs or oscilloscopes with the phone's internal timer.

Mode Three: Similar to the first mode with saving, but not based on the internal timer. Here, with each input value, we move forward one unit. So, if the input speed is high, the graph will be drawn faster, or you can send data slowly per minute depending on your application.

Mode Four: Similar to the third mode without saving, with zoom functionality. This mode is ideal for creating an oscilloscope or viewing wave samples with zoom and freeze capabilities.

Note: If you exit the program and start graphing again, the first graphing page will be considered as the initial state, and the first page graphing will be deleted, replacing it with subsequent graphs. So, if yesterday's graph is important to you, back it up, or better yet, click on the graph and go to the last empty page to keep the initial graphs intact. Alternatively, you can change the name of the button to have a new series of graphs without altering the previous ones. If you want to see the previous graph, just change the button name back. If you receive a graph folder from a friend, you can also set the button name to match the received graph to view or continue those graphs

With a click on any running graph, a list view (Run/Stop View) will be displayed, and if you are in the non-saving mode, a zoom option will be added

# LED Strip Control Algorithm for RANGMANG Module

## Overview
The RANGMANG color module controls RGB LED strips (WS2811, WS2812, and WS2813) using Bluetooth and programmable serial commands. The module operates on Mega8, Mega128, and Mega64 microcontrollers and requires a 22-digit input code for precise LED control.

## Microcontroller Capabilities
- The **Mega8** microcontroller supports **255 pixels** and **12 lighting patterns** due to its limited memory.  
- The **Mega128 & Mega64** microcontrollers support **990 pixels** and **30 lighting effects** for larger LED configurations.  

## Programming via Bluetooth
A **serial Bluetooth adapter** connects to the module, allowing control via Android applications such as **Soifesign**. Commands are transmitted in a **structured 22-digit format**.

## Transmission Code Structure
Each command consists of **22 digits**, divided into the following components:

1. **Module Address (2 digits)**  
   - `01–98` → Address for individual modules  
   - `99` → Broadcast command for all modules  

2. **Mode Type (2 digits)**  
   - `00` → Static Color Mode  
   - `01–30` → Dynamic Lighting Effects  

3. **Red Color Value (3 digits)**  
   - `000–255` → Intensity level (000 = Off, 255 = Full)  

4. **Green Color Value (3 digits)**  
   - `000–255` → Intensity level  

5. **Blue Color Value (3 digits)**  
   - `000–255` → Intensity level  

6. **Start Pixel Address (3 digits)**  
   - `000–255` → First pixel to be colored  

7. **Finish Pixel Address (3 digits)**  
   - `001–255` → Last pixel to be colored  

8. **Memory Slot (3 digits)**  
   - `001–010` → Stores predefined colors  

## Algorithm Breakdown

### **Step 1: Receive User Input**
- The system listens for **22-digit serial input** via Bluetooth.  
- If the input length is **not 22 digits**, return an error.  

### **Step 2: Parse the Data**
- Extract **Module Address** (digits 1–2).  
- Extract **Mode Type** (digits 3–4).  
- Extract **Color Values** (digits 5–13).  
- Extract **Pixel Range** (digits 14–19).  
- Extract **Memory Slot** (digits 20–22).  

### **Step 3: Validate Input**
- Ensure **Module Address** is between `01–99`.  
- Validate **Mode Type** (`00–12`) mega 8    (`00–30`) mega64 or mega128 
- Ensure **Color Values** are between `000–255`.  
- Check if **Start Pixel < Finish Pixel** within hardware constraints.  
- Verify **Memory Slot** (`001–010` for color storage).  

### **Step 4: Apply Settings**
- If `Mode = 00`, set the specified pixels to a static color.  
- If `Mode > 00`, trigger corresponding **lighting effects**.  
- Update the LED strip's **memory slot** if applicable.  

### **Step 5: Special Cases**
- `996` → Clears memory slots **001 to 010**.  
- `997` → Temporarily turn off LED strip (without erasing memory).  
- `998` → Apply a uniform color without saving.  
- `999` → Apply a uniform color **and save it** to memory.  

### **Step 6: Execute & Update**
- Transmit updated values to the LED strip.  
- Apply changes dynamically or store values for future execution.  
- Provide feedback via serial Bluetooth communication.

## Example Commands

1. **Set first half of strip to solid Green and  memory = 2 (Mega8, ws2812 5 meter  150 Pixels)**
 adress  mod    Red   Green    Blue   pixel Start   pixel End       memory

note out :

When the button is configured in behavior note mode, you can use the info icon in the top left corner. By selecting the task option from the info list, you can choose between two types of tasks: sending via Bluetooth or sending via API/Server.

'''''''''''''
Send via Bluetooth:

In this mode, you can send your text to the Bluetooth serial output. The send icon will appear at the top of the screen. By long-pressing this icon, you can access the send type settings, listed from top to bottom:

Delay:

After selecting the delay, a time selection bar will appear at the bottom of the screen. Note that the times depend on the phone's internal timer. Ensure the custom wait option is turned off. In this mode, the first line of your text is sent as the command, and subsequent lines wait for the delay time to elapse before being sent. The delay time is the same for all lines.

LF RF:

This setting defines the data send method and how it is received by the recipient. It includes characters 10 and 13 or the absence thereof, sequential reception, or next line reception. This setting should be configured according to the recipient's method.

Automatic Sending: This setting determines whether the sending is manual or automatic. In manual mode, an icon appears for each send, which you click to send the line. In automatic mode, the sending is done automatically based on delay settings, custom delays, or input checks.

Input Check:

This setting is for serial echo or verifying the correctness of the sent value. The recipient should resend what it receives, and the data is checked. If the received and sent data match, the next line is sent. If not, it checks 5 times and gives an error if the send is not confirmed.

Next  Word Check:

If the word "next" or "NEXT" is received, the next line is sent. This setting is suitable for actions with unspecified durations. For example, in a loader where start and end times vary, the next word triggers the next command when a switch is defined at the end.

Custom Wait:

This method allows you to set custom times for sending lines. The times must be written in the text, following this format:

First line: Command

Second line: Time in seconds (only numbers) 

Example:

motor ON
23
Fan ON
11
Vacuum OFF
5


If there is an error in your text, it will give an error.

Loop:

This setting repeats your text or commands. Once activated, your text starts again from the first line after the last line is completed.


 Send via Server/API:
 
All functionalities of this method are similar to the Bluetooth send method, with the following differences:

The input check and next word options are removed.

Writing method when using delay:


First line: Address with port

Second line: Key or keyword

Third line: Data value or sending value


Writing method when using custom wait:


First line: Address with port

Second line: Key or keyword

Third line: Data value or sending value

Fourth line: Delay time in seconds (only numbers)

Phone Sensor:

In the Phone Sensor section, you can use the sensors inside the phone in soifdesign. These sensors work normally, and if you select the active options of these sensors, the program can use the values of these sensors. By enabling the Display Sensor Values option, you can see the values and addresses of these sensors.

Preferably, these sensors are included in the ending addresses 991 to 994 so that buttons can read and display them through these addresses. The application of reading these sensors can lead to button effects. To read the sensors, just set the button behavior to the Bluetooth Receive mode and then enter the sensor address:

Address 991 for the light sensor: You can get the maximum value from the sensor display section by shining a lot of light like the sun.

Address 992 for the X-axis rotation sensor: You can get the maximum value from the sensor display section by rotating the phone until the maximum positive is visible. The sensor value may be decimal and negative. Note that the buttons work from 0 upwards, so by multiplying the number, correct the decimal part and by adding a suitable number, make the negative part positive. For example, if the sensor shows 1.52, this number must be multiplied by 100 to be read as 152. Now, for example, we have a maximum negative of -2.11, which becomes -211. So, multiply by 10 and add 211. Now the sensor's minimum value is 0 and the maximum is 422, and 210 is the balance or median.

Address 993 for the Y-axis rotation sensor: Similar to the explanation above.

Address 994 for the magnetic sensor: Pay attention that the output may vary slightly in different phones. With the help of a coefficient and a magnet, you can find the highest resolution. The type of multiplication and addition is similar to the explanation above.

Now you can have your desired programs such as light measurement, graphs, and movements by selecting button effects. Create programs like a scale or metal detector.

If you want to move a device or toy using the phone's internal rotation sensors, just set the button behavior to Bluetooth Send mode. Then, using the Sensor option, select the desired sensor. The sensor value will be sent to the Bluetooth serial output, and if you wish to have a suffix or address appended to the sent value, just enter that sentence or address inside the textbox.

With sensor value changes, the sensor values will be automatically sent to the Bluetooth serial output. Note that in this feature, the sent number is not negative; it is 0 and above.

Additionally, you can view the sent value on the button itself. This value is only for display purposes and is not sent! You can configure the display options as "Name + Value + Address," "Value + Address + Name," "Value + Address," "Value," or "Name."

Important: In the section for setting the sensor to be sent, configuring another address will not send the value with addresses 991 to 994, because only the sensor value itself is sent. If you enter an address in the textbox, the value will be attached to your address and sent together, with the value first and then the address concatenated.
